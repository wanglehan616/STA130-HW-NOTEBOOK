    "When you're interacting with the ChatBot about enhancing the Markovian ChatBot code, you can guide it with hints instead of directly providing the answers. Hereâ€™s how you might approach the conversation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggested Prompts to Guide the ChatBot\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Introduce the Concept of Character-Specific Chains**:\n",
    "   - \"What if we wanted our ChatBot to respond differently based on characters? How could we structure the Markov chains to account for that?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Explain Bigrams**:\n",
    "   - \"Instead of just relying on the previous word for generating text, what if we used pairs of words? How would that change the way we build our Markov chain?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Encourage Exploration**:\n",
    "   - \"If I have a sentence like 'The cat sat on the mat', how would we represent the relationship between 'cat' and 'sat' using bigrams?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ask for Implementation Ideas**:\n",
    "   - \"How might we modify the `build_chain` method to store bigrams instead of single words? What data structure could help with this?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Character-Specific Example**:\n",
    "   - \"If I wanted to generate responses for characters like 'Alice' and 'Bob' separately, how could we organize our data to facilitate that?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Follow-Up Questions\n",
    "- \"What changes would be necessary to ensure that each character has their own unique chain?\"\n",
    "- \"How would using bigrams improve the coherence of the generated text compared to using single words?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Check for Understanding\n",
    "At the end, ask the ChatBot:\n",
    "- \"Can you summarize how we might implement character-specific Markov chains and bigram dependencies in our ChatBot?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outcome\n",
    "This approach encourages the ChatBot to think critically about the extensions you're suggesting and to engage with the concepts in a deeper way. If the ChatBot struggles, you can offer additional hints or clarify concepts to help guide it toward the answers."

    "### Start with the Code Overview\n",
    "1. **Introduction**: Begin by stating that you want to understand the details of the Markovian ChatBot code.\n",
    "   - \"I have this Markovian ChatBot code, and I'd like you to help me understand how it works.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Break Down the Code\n",

    "   - **Class Definition**: \"What does the `class MarkovianChatBot:` line do? Why is it useful to define a class here?\"\n",
    "   - **Initialization**: \"Can you explain what happens in the `__init__` method and how the parameters are being used?\"\n",
    "   - **Building the Markov Chain**: \"What is the purpose of the `build_chain` method, and how does it create relationships between words?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Explore Key Concepts**:\n",
    "   - **Markov Chain**: \"Can you explain what a Markov chain is in the context of this code?\"\n",
    "   - **Word Choices**: \"How does the ChatBot decide which word to use next in the response generation?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discuss Enhancements\n",
    "4. **Character-Specific Chains**: \n",
    "   - \"How could we modify this code to support different characters having their own responses? What would need to change in the structure?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Using Bigrams**:\n",
    "   - \"If we wanted to implement bigrams instead of single words, how would we adjust the `build_chain` method? What implications does this have for response generation?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Confirm Understanding\n",
    "6. **Summarize**: \n",
    "   - \"Can you summarize what weâ€™ve discussed about the structure of this ChatBot and how it generates text?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Follow-Up Questions\n",
    "If you encounter areas that are confusing, you can ask:\n",
    "- \"I donâ€™t understand why we use a dictionary to store the Markov chains. Can you clarify that?\"\n",
    "- \"What happens if there are no next words for the current word? How does the code handle that scenario?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Review\n",
    "After gathering explanations and insights, you can ask the ChatBot for a recap:\n",
    "- \"Could you give me a quick summary of how the Markovian ChatBot operates and any key points I should remember?\"\n",
    "\n",
