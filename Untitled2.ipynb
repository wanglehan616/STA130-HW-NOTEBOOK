    "\n",
    "- **Mean**: The average of all data points.\n",
    "- **Median**: The middle value when data points are sorted.\n",
    "- **Skewness**: A measure of asymmetry in the distribution of data. It can be:\n",
    "  - **Right Skewed (Positive Skew)**: The tail on the right side is longer or fatter than the left side.\n",
    "  - **Left Skewed (Negative Skew)**: The tail on the left side is longer or fatter than the right side.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided code uses the `scipy` library to generate a gamma distribution sample and creates a histogram to visualize it. Let's break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "from scipy import stats\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import plotly.express as px\n",

    "\n",
    "median_sample1 = np.quantile(sample1, [0.5])\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analyzing the First Sample\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Histogram**: The histogram visualizes the distribution of `sample1`. Since it’s drawn from a gamma distribution, it is typically right-skewed.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Mean and Median Calculation**: The code computes the mean and median, allowing us to analyze their relationship.\n",
    "\n",

    "median_sample2 = np.quantile(sample2, [0.5])\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Right Skewed Distributions**:\n",
    "   - In right-skewed distributions (like `sample1`), the tail on the right pulls the mean to the right of the median. Thus, the mean is greater than the median.\n",
    "   - **Why?** The presence of higher values (outliers) on the right side increases the mean more than the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Left Skewed Distributions**:\n",
    "   - In left-skewed distributions (like `sample2`), the tail on the left pulls the mean to the left of the median. Thus, the mean is less than the median.\n",
    "   - **Why?** The presence of lower values (outliers) on the left side decreases the mean more than the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the relationship between the mean, median, and skewness can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Right Skew**: Mean > Median\n",
    "- **Left Skew**: Mean < Median\n",
    "- **Symmetrical Distribution**: Mean = Median\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "By generating both right-skewed and left-skewed samples, we can visualize how the mean and median behave differently depending on the skewness of the distribution. This understanding helps in interpreting data and making statistical inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can further extend this analysis by exploring additional distributions and visualizing their behaviors in similar cells within a notebook. Don't forget to summarize your findings and include references to the generated figures!"
