    "     The SD measures the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values in the original data. It tells us how much individual data points deviate from the mean of the dataset. A high SD indicates that the data points are spread out over a wide range of values, while a low SD suggests that they are clustered close to the mean.\n",

    "     The SEM, on the other hand, quantifies how much the sample mean is expected to fluctuate from the true population mean. It is calculated as the standard deviation of the sample divided by the square root of the sample size (n). The SEM decreases as the sample size increases, reflecting that larger samples tend to provide more accurate estimates of the population mean.\n",

    "To create a 95% confidence interval using the standard error of the mean (SEM), follow these steps:\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Calculate Bootstrapped Means: For each bootstrapped sample, compute the mean. This will give you a distribution of means.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use np.quantile: To find the 95% confidence interval, apply the `np.quantile(...)` function to your collection of bootstrapped means. Specifically, you will want to find the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile:\n",

    "Variability and Sample Size:\n",
    "The variability of sample means decreases with increasing sample size because larger samples tend to provide more accurate estimates of the population mean. However, in bootstrapping, we always use samples of the same size as the original dataset to maintain consistency and reflect the same sampling variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrapped samples are created by sampling with replacement, meaning that individual data points can be selected multiple times within the same bootstrapped sample. This method preserves the original sample size while still allowing for the estimation of variability in means across multiple samples. Sampling without replacement would change the characteristics of the samples and does not accurately represent the uncertainty inherent in the original dataset."

    "1. Imports: We import NumPy for numerical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sample Data: We create an example dataset `data` with numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Bootstrap Function:\n",
    "   - Function Definition: `bootstrap_ci` takes the data, the number of bootstrap samples, the statistic to calculate (mean or median), and the confidence level (default is 0.95).\n",
    "   - Sample Size: The length of the input data is stored in `n`.\n",
    "   - Generate Samples: We use `np.random.choice` to create `num_samples` bootstrap samples from the data, allowing replacement.\n",
    "   - Calculate Statistics: For each bootstrap sample, we compute the specified statistic (mean or median).\n",
    "   - Percentiles: We calculate the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval using `np.percentile` based on the desired confidence level.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Calculate Confidence Intervals:\n",
    "   - First, we call the `bootstrap_ci` function with the statistic set to `np.mean` to get the confidence interval for the mean.\n",
    "   - Next, we call the same function but change the statistic to `np.median` for the median confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modifications:\n",
    "To calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for other statistics, simply change the `statistic` parameter when calling `bootstrap_ci`. For instance, to calculate the 75th percentile instead of the mean or median, you can define a custom function that computes the desired statistic and pass it to the `bootstrap_ci` function.\n"

    "In statistics, distinguishing between population parameters and sample statistics is crucial for understanding confidence intervals. Here’s a concise explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Definitions:\n",
    "   -Population Parameter: This is a value that describes a characteristic of an entire population (e.g., the true mean or median). It is often unknown and fixed.\n",
    "   -Sample Statistic: This is a value calculated from a sample of the population (e.g., the mean of a sample). It varies depending on which individuals are included in the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Role in Confidence Intervals:\n",
    "   -Estimation: Confidence intervals provide a range of values within which we believe the population parameter lies, based on the sample statistic. The sample statistic serves as our best estimate of the unknown population parameter.\n",
    "   -Uncertainty: Since the sample statistic is subject to variability (different samples can yield different statistics), confidence intervals quantify the uncertainty associated with using a sample to infer information about the population.\n",
    "   -Interpretation: Confidence intervals help us understand how confident we can be that our sample statistic reflects the true population parameter. They indicate the range of plausible values for the parameter based on the data collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Importance: Recognizing this distinction allows us to make more informed decisions and inferences about a population based on limited data. It emphasizes that while we can estimate population parameters, there is always uncertainty involved, which confidence intervals help to express."

    "# Why does a confidence interval overlapping zero \"fail to reject the null hypothesis\"?\n",

    "Even if our sample mean is not zero (let’s say it's 2), the confidence interval might still stretch from -1 to 5. This means there’s a chance that the true average effect of the drug could be zero or even negative (suggesting the drug could have no effect or a harmful effect). Because of this uncertainty, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, which states that there is no effect. In essence, we don't have enough strong evidence from our sample to conclude that the drug does anything significant on average.\n",
